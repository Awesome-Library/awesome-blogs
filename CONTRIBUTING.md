# Contributing

To contribute to this list, please find the appropriate category for the blog you recommend. If there's no category that works for you, feel free to create it.

## Table of Content

- [Creating categories and subcategories](#creating-categories-and-subcategories)
- [Adding a new submission](#adding-a-new-submission)
  - [Submission of an awesome blog](#submission-of-an-awesome-blog)
  - [Submission of your own blog](#submission-of-your-own-blog)
- [General rules](#general-rules)

## Creating categories and subcategories

To create a new category, simply write it down at the bottom of the file like this:

```gfm
## NAME
```

To create a new subcategory, just put one more `#` sign.

After this, update the Table of Content section at the top of the file by adding your new (sub)category like this:

```gfm
- [NAME](#name)
```

## Adding a new submission

### Submission of an awesome blog

After you find or create a specific category to place your recommendation, find an empty place and add your entry by typing:

```gfm
##### [NAME-OF-THE-BLOG](link-to-the-blog)

Commentary - [@your-github-username](link-to-your-github-profile)
```

Since there is _a lot_ of blogs available on the Internet, it is important to write down why do you think that this blog is awesome. Pull Requests without the commentary _will **not** be accepted_.

### Submission of your own blog

If you are the author on the blog you're submitting, follow this:

```gfm
##### [NAME-OF-THE-BLOG](link-to-the-blog)

**AUTHOR**: Commentary - [@your-github-username](link-to-your-github-profile)
```

Write down the comment on why do you think that your blog is awesome and why should the rest of us check it out.

## General rules

* Some blogs might fit in more than one (sub)category. If this is the case, feel free to include them in all of the (sub)categories. However, if the blog is not written in English, it can only go into the Non-English category.
* If the authors post in more than one language (lets say English and Spanish as an example), then look at their post archive and see in which language do they post more. If it is English, put them into an appropriate category. If it is Spanish, put them into the Non-English section.
* Blogs need to have more than ten posts already published at the time of their submission. Don't post new blogs.
